# Developer Tools *for Craft CMS*

> This plugin is no longer maintained. I'm committing to Craft 3 development only. Feel free to use the source code as you like. If you're looking for a Craft 3 version of this plugin, it's likely I've merged parts or all of this plugin into my [Helpers module.](https://github.com/marknotton/craft-module-helpers)

Adds a number of tools to help during development.

Originally forked from [Piccirilli Dorsey's Sidebar Enhancer](https://github.com/picdorsey/craft-sidebarenhancer). A big Thank you for Piccirilli for your hard work.

More developer tools will be coming soon.
